    description: >
      Information about all monitored tables. This is currently only table which is supposed to be edited (you can think of it as a configuration table) 
      2 columns can be changed there:
        - Change `actively_monitored` to `true`/`false` to start/stop monitoring table and computing stats for it, `(default: false)`
        - Change `time_filter` to name of column you would like to use as time filter
          Time filter is important thing in `re_data`, it's used in all filters computing metrics (to filter records added in a given day)
          One the start some educated guess :) is assigned as this field, but quite often it may require to be changed. `(default: first timestamp type column)`
          
      **Important: default behaviour for newly discovered tables**

      By default (assuming env variable `re_data:actively_monitored_by_default` hasn't been changed tables are not monitored. So first `re_data`
      run should just find tables to monitor but don't actually compute metrics. This is for you so that you can check confirmation and run it for tables you wish.
      You can obviously just update all `actively_monitored` parameters to true if you want to run it for all tables or even set `re_data:actively_monitored_by_default` to true.

      Information about all monitored columns, this contains information about columns similar to this
      what you can find in `information_schema`. This table is not supposed to be edited and new columns will be added and old removed
      in case of schema changes for your tables.
