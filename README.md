# What is re_data?

re_data is an open-source data reliability framework for the modern data stack. ðŸ˜Š

Currently, re_data focuses on observing the dbt project (together with underlying data warehouse - Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).

Data transformations in re_data are implemented and exposed as models & macros in this dbt package.
