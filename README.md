# What is re_data?

re_data is a set of tools (dbt macros & models) that helps you with making sure your data pipelines are clean & reliable. 😊

## Data Preparation

re_data data preparation macros help you clean your data faster, with less code & a smaller chance of errors.
Currently, we support four types of data preparation:

- data cleaning
- data filtering
- data normalization
- data validation

## Data Monitoring

re_data metrics & alerts models contain information about data quality which lets you discover bad data much faster. You can:
 - use built-in metrics & extend them with your code
 - test them as normal dbt models
 - visualize them in your favourite BI tool
 - trigger external (Slack/Pagerduty/etc.) alerts based on them
